# Netflix Data Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Python.
The goal is to understand trends in Netflix content, such as content types, release years, countries, and growth over time.

This project focuses on practicing data cleaning, data exploration, and visualization using real-world data.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **Netflix Movies and TV Shows**, obtained from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

The dataset contains information such as:
- Type (Movie or TV Show)
- Title
- Director and cast
- Country
- Date added to Netflix
- Release year
- Rating
- Duration
- Genres
- Description


## What this project does
- Loads and explores the Netflix dataset
- Checks for missing values and cleans the data
- Converts date columns to proper datetime format
- Analyzes how Netflix content has grown over time
- Visualizes trends using charts and graphs
- Answers basic questions about movies vs TV shows and release patterns


## What I learned
- Working with real-world datasets that contain missing and messy data
- Using `pandas` for data cleaning and analysis
- Converting and extracting information from datetime columns
- Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visualizations
- Interpreting data trends and patterns
- Organizing a data analysis project in a clear and readable way


## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Google Colab (for development)
- Kaggle (dataset source)


## How to run the project
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open the notebook or Python file in Google Colab or a local environment.
4. Run the cells or script step by step to see the analysis and visualizations.


## Notes
This project focuses on data exploration and visualization rather than advanced modeling or machine learning.
